## **GE23131 â€“ Programming using C (ES)**

**Lessons (Topics):**

* Basics: variables, constants, data types, I/O
* Control structures: branching, looping, nested loops
* Arrays (1D/2D), searching & sorting
* Strings and string handling functions
* Functions & recursion
* Scope, storage classes
* Structures, unions, pointers
* Preprocessor macros

**Lab Experiments:**

1. Simple programs with variables/data types
2. Decision making (if/else, switch)
3. Loops (for, while, do)
4. Searching algorithms (linear, binary)
5. Sorting (bubble, selection)
6. Matrix operations (addition, multiplication)
7. String handling programs
8. Recursive functions (factorial, Fibonacci)
9. Pointers & arrays
10. Structures & unions programs
