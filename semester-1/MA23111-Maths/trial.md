⸻

🧩 1️⃣ Vector Spaces

⸻

⚙️ Definition

A vector space V over a field F is a non-empty set of elements (vectors) that satisfy 8 axioms under two operations — vector addition and scalar multiplication.

⸻

🧮 8 Conditions of a Vector Space

No.	Property	Description
1	Closure under addition	If u,v∈V, then u+v∈V.
2	Commutative addition	u+v=v+u.
3	Associative addition	(u+v)+w=u+(v+w).
4	Existence of zero vector	There exists 0∈V such that u+0=u.
5	Existence of additive inverse	For each u∈V, ∃ (−u) such that u+(−u)=0.
6	Closure under scalar multiplication	c·u∈V for all c∈F.
7	Distributive property	c(u+v)=cu+cv.
8	Compatibility of scalar multiplication	(ab)u=a(bu); 1u=u.


⸻

💡 Examples

Example Type	Vector Space	Explanation
Coordinate	ℝ², ℝ³, ℝⁿ	Tuples (x₁,…,xₙ) under normal addition/scalar mult.
Polynomials	Pₙ	All polynomials ≤ degree n
Matrices	Mₘ×ₙ	All m×n real matrices
Functions	C[a,b]	All continuous functions
Zero Space	{0}	Contains only the zero vector


⸻

⚙️ Zero Vector & Inverses
	•	Zero vector: unique element that leaves every vector unchanged when added.
	•	Additive inverse: vector which cancels another to yield zero.
	•	Multiplicative inverse (scalar side): relates to reciprocal of scalar.

⸻

🧠 MCQ Practice

(Theory)
	1.	Vector space must be closed under ?
→ Addition & scalar multiplication ✅
	2.	Set of all positive integers under addition → not vector space ✅
	3.	Zero vector uniqueness → True ✅

(Numerical)
Add vectors, find inverses, check closure, etc.

(Practical)
Temperature readings, pixel intensities, and voltage signals all behave as vector spaces.

⸻

⸻

🧩 2️⃣ Subspaces

⸻

⚙️ Definition

A subspace W of a vector space V is a subset that itself is a vector space under the same operations.

✅ Conditions for Subspace
	1.	0∈W (contains zero)
	2.	Closed under addition
	3.	Closed under scalar multiplication

⸻

💡 Examples

Subspace	Description
Line y=2x in ℝ²	Passes through origin → subspace
Plane x+y+z=0 in ℝ³	Subspace of ℝ³
{0}	Zero subspace
Set of all even functions	Subspace of continuous functions
Solutions of homogeneous equation Ax=0	Null space → subspace


⸻

🧠 Key Properties

Concept	Meaning
Intersection of subspaces	Always a subspace
Union of subspaces	Not always a subspace
Sum of subspaces	Always a subspace
Smallest subspace	{0}
Largest subspace	V itself


⸻

🧮 Examples
	1.	W=\{(x,y):y=2x\} → subspace ✅
	2.	W=\{(x,y):y=x+1\} → not subspace ❌ (fails zero vector).
	3.	Plane through origin → subspace ✅

⸻

🧠 MCQs

(Theory)
	•	Subspace must include zero → True ✅
	•	Intersection → always subspace ✅

(Numerical)
	•	y=2x → yes ✅

⸻

🧩 3️⃣ Linear Combinations and Systems of Linear Equations

⸻

⚙️ Definition

A linear combination of vectors v_1,v_2,…,v_n is:
c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + … + c_nv_n
where c_i are scalars.

The set of all such combinations = span{v₁,…,vₙ}.

⸻

💡 Matrix Relation

For matrix A with columns a₁,a₂,…,aₙ,
A x = b \Rightarrow b = x_1 a_1 + x_2 a_2 + … + x_n a_n
So b is a linear combination of columns of A.
System is consistent ↔ b ∈ Col(A).

⸻

⚙️ Homogeneous Systems

A x = 0
→ Always consistent (x=0 works).
→ Solution set = null space (subspace).

⸻

🧠 Examples
	1.	Span{(1,0),(0,1)} = ℝ²
	2.	Span{(1,2),(2,4)} = line y=2x (dependent)
	3.	A=\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\2&4\end{bmatrix}, b=(3,6) → consistent ✅

⸻

🧠 MCQs

(Theory)
	•	b is combination of A’s columns ↔ A x=b has solution ✅
	•	Set of all combinations → span ✅
	•	Homogeneous systems always consistent ✅

(Numerical)
	•	Rank-nullity use ✅

(Practical)
	•	Regression models, circuits, and data fitting use linear combinations.

⸻

⸻

🧩 4️⃣ Linear Independence, Dependence, and Basis

⸻

⚙️ Definition
	•	Independent: only trivial combination gives 0
c_1v_1+…+c_nv_n=0 \Rightarrow c_i=0
	•	Dependent: some non-zero combination gives 0
	•	Basis: set of independent vectors that spans V
	•	Dimension: number of vectors in any basis

⸻

💡 Examples

Example	Independence	Dimension
{(1,0),(0,1)} in ℝ²	Independent	2
{(1,2),(2,4)}	Dependent	1 (line)
{1,x,x²}	Independent basis for P₂	3


⸻

⚙️ How to Check Independence

Method	Idea
Definition	Solve c₁v₁+…+c_nv_n=0
Determinant	det ≠ 0 → independent
Rank test	rank = number of vectors → independent
RREF	pivot in each column → independent
Geometric	Not parallel/coplanar → independent


⸻

💡 Relation Summary

Concept	Condition
Independent	Only trivial solution
Dependent	At least one non-trivial solution
Basis	Independent + spans
Dimension	#basis vectors
Span	Subspace generated by vectors


⸻

🧠 MCQs

(Theory)
	•	Zero vector in set → dependent ✅
	•	All bases have same #vectors ✅

(Numerical)
	•	det=0 → dependent ✅
	•	rank+nullity=n ✅

(Practical)
	•	RGB basis for colors, PCA components → basis ✅

⸻

🧩 5️⃣ Linear Transformations, Matrices, Null & Range Spaces

⸻

⚙️ Definition

A linear transformation T:V→W satisfies:
T(u+v)=T(u)+T(v),\quad T(cu)=cT(u)
Every linear map from ℝⁿ→ℝᵐ can be represented by an m×n matrix A:
T(x)=A x

⸻

⚙️ Matrix Representation Steps
	1.	Apply T to each basis vector of domain.
	2.	Express each T(vᵢ) as coordinates in codomain basis.
	3.	Use these coordinate columns to form matrix [T].

⸻

💡 Example

T(x,y)=(x+y,2x−y)
T(e₁)=(1,2),\;T(e₂)=(1,−1)
\Rightarrow [T]=\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\2&−1\end{bmatrix}

⸻

🧮 Null and Range

Concept	Definition	Subspace of	Dimension
Null space / Kernel	{x: A x=0}	Domain	Nullity
Range / Image	{A x: x∈V}	Codomain	Rank

Rank–Nullity Theorem:
\text{rank}(A)+\text{nullity}(A)=n

⸻

💡 Example

Projection T(x,y,z)=(x,y,0)
[T]=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&0\end{bmatrix}
→ rank=2 (plane), nullity=1 (z-axis)

⸻

🧠 MCQs

(Theory)
	•	Linear map satisfies additivity & homogeneity ✅
	•	Columns of [T] = images of basis vectors ✅

(Numerical)
	•	rank(A)=1 ⇒ nullity= n−1 ✅
	•	diag(1,0,0): rank=1, nullity=2 ✅

(Practical)
	•	Rotations/scaling = linear maps ✅
	•	Graphics projections, robotics, neural networks use these ✅

⸻

⸻

🧩 6️⃣ Dimension Theorem (Rank–Nullity Theorem)

⸻

⚙️ Statement

For any linear map T:V→W:
\dim(V) = \dim(\ker T) + \dim(\operatorname{im} T)
or for matrices:
\text{rank}(A)+\text{nullity}(A)=n

⸻

💡 Interpretation
	•	Rank → #independent outputs (image)
	•	Nullity → #inputs that map to zero
	•	Their sum = total dimension of domain

⸻

🧮 Examples
	1.	A=\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\2&4\end{bmatrix}: rank=1, nullity=1 → 1+1=2 ✅
	2.	A=\text{diag}(1,1,0): rank=2, nullity=1 → 3D space ✅
	3.	T(p)=p’ on P₃: rank=3, nullity=1 → 4D domain ✅

⸻

🧠 Consequences

Property	Meaning
Nullity=0 → injective	one-to-one
Rank=dim(W) → surjective	onto
Square full rank → invertible	bijective
rank=row rank=col rank	equality always holds


⸻

🧠 MCQs

(Theory)
	•	rank+nullity=dim(domain) ✅
	•	Rank=dim(image) ✅
	•	Nullity=dim(kernel) ✅

(Numerical)
	•	rank=3, n=5 → nullity=2 ✅
	•	rank=2, nullity=0 → one-to-one ✅

(Practical)
	•	In AI, rank→info capacity; nullity→redundancy ✅

⸻

⸻

🧩 7️⃣ Matrix Representation of Linear Transformation

⸻

⚙️ Steps Recap
	1.	Choose bases for domain and codomain.
	2.	Apply T to each basis vector.
	3.	Express each T(vᵢ) as coordinates in codomain basis.
	4.	Form matrix with those coordinate columns.

[T]_{B_W}^{B_V} = [T(v_1)\; T(v_2)\; …\; T(v_n)]

⸻

💡 Example

Differentiation T(p)=p’ in basis {1,x,x²}:

T(1)=0,\;T(x)=1,\;T(x²)=2x
\Rightarrow [T]=
\begin{bmatrix}
0&1&0\\
0&0&2\\
0&0&0
\end{bmatrix}

⸻

🧠 Key Properties

Operation	Matrix Rule
Composition	[T₂∘T₁] = [T₂][T₁]
Sum	[T₁+T₂]=[T₁]+[T₂]
Inverse	Exists iff A invertible
Change of basis	[T]’ = P^{-1}[T]P
